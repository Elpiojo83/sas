This Extension was developed based on
 - HTML5 Boilerplate (http://html5boilerplate.com)
 - Extension html5boilerplate
 - Extension html5_kickstart
 
Many Thanks to the people involved in the development of these excellent projects and extensions!
 
Since both extensions mentioned above on their own were missing some essential features for me, I tried my best to combine and enhance them and add additional functionality as well.

I hope you like the result!
